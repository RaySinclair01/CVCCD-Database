This repository hosts the **Chinese Vegetable Cadmium Contamination Database (CVCCD)**, a comprehensive, interactive web-based platform designed for the exploration and analysis of cadmium (Cd) pollution in vegetables across China and its associated human health risks.

This platform serves as a powerful academic tool for researchers, policymakers, and the public to query, visualize, and understand the complex dynamics of cadmium contamination in the food chain.

## ‚ú® Features

The CVCCD platform offers a rich set of interactive features for in-depth data analysis:

-   **Interactive Data Filtering:** Users can dynamically filter the extensive dataset by multiple criteria, including:
    -   Province
    -   Major Vegetable Category
    -   Specific Vegetable Type
    -   Soil Type
    -   Climate Zone
-   **Keyword Search:** A powerful search function allows for querying across all data fields to quickly locate specific records.
-   **Real-time Statistical Analysis:** An interactive dashboard that automatically calculates and displays key statistics based on the currently filtered data, including:
    -   Average, range, and sample size for Soil Cd, Vegetable Cd, pH, SOM, and CEC.
    -   Aggregated Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) values for different population groups (Urban/Rural, Male/Female).
-   **Dynamic Data Visualization:** A suite of interactive charts, powered by Chart.js, that update in real-time as filters are applied:
    -   Regional Soil vs. Vegetable Cd Content
    -   Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) by Vegetable Category
    -   Top 15 Vegetables with the Highest Cd Content
    -   Time-series Trends for THQ, BCF, and Cd Levels
    -   Provincial THQ Risk Comparison
    -   Impact of Season and Soil Type on Cadmium Transfer
-   **Paginated Data Table:** A clean and responsive table for viewing raw data, with easy-to-use pagination controls.
-   **Excel Data Import:** Users can upload their own `.xlsx` or `.xls` files to instantly visualize and analyze their datasets using the platform's tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

-   **Frontend:** The entire platform is a self-contained single-page application built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
-   **Data Visualization:** All charts are rendered using the powerful and flexible **[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)** library.
-   **Excel Parsing:** Client-side Excel file reading and parsing is handled by the **[SheetJS (xlsx.js)](https://sheetjs.com/)** library.
-   **Deployment:** The application is a static website that can be hosted on any web server or opened directly from the local file system.
